# 🚀 BOLT.new Boilerplate SaaS

> Because who needs a million tokens when you can start with awesome?

## 🎯 What's This All About?

Hey there, fellow builder! 👋

Ever thought "I wish someone would save me from spending my first million tokens just setting up a SaaS"? Well, wish granted! 🧞‍♂️

This is a lightning-fast ⚡ (get it? BOLT? 😉) boilerplate that gets you from zero to SaaS hero in just 5 minutes!

THE PROMPT:
Create a hyper modern, clean, mobile responsive and dark/light enabled full stack SaaS application with landing page inspired by Stripe's amazing easthetic, user and admin auth, seed 1 admin and 1 user and place them on login screen for demo. Add user and admin dashboard. Profile. Settings. User management. Include framer for intuitive movement and toast there relevant. Step this through and we will complete in a few steps if needed, just let me know which you do and which is next and we can refine as we go. Store any sensitive keys in .env and I'll update those for you as we go.

## 🛠️ The Stack of Awesomeness

- 🏗️ **VITE + TailwindCSS + Next.js** - Because life's too short for ugly apps

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Head over to [BOLT.new Boilerplate](https://bolt.new/~/sb1-sutfie)
2. Clone it like it's hot 🔥
3. ???
4. Profit! 💰

That's it...this next part is for later...

## The Next Steps

The following are installed but not fully implemented, so you can modify as needed.

- 🔐 **Clerk** - Authentication so smooth, it's like butter
- 📨 **Pusher** - Real-time updates faster than you can say "websocket"
- 💳 **Stripe** - Money handling that doesn't make you cry

## 🌩️ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables in Netlify

Set up these magical incantations (a.k.a. environment variables) in Netlify:

- \`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\`
- \`CLERK_SECRET_KEY\`
- \`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\`
- \`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET\`
- \`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\`
- \`PUSHER_APP_ID\`
- \`PUSHER_SECRET\`
- \`NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY\`
- \`NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER\`

### 2. Set up Clerk Authentication

1. Add your shiny new Netlify deployment URL to the allowed domains in Clerk
2. Configure OAuth providers (if you're feeling social)
3. Update those redirect URLs in the Clerk dashboard (because we all love a good redirect)

### 3. Configure Stripe

1. Add your Netlify deployment URL to your Stripe webhook endpoints (so Stripe knows where to send the money vibes)
2. Update the webhook secret in Netlify environment variables (keep it secret, keep it safe)

### 4. Set up Pusher

1. Configure the Pusher app settings with your Netlify deployment URL (so Pusher knows where to push to)
2. Ensure CORS settings are properly configured (because CORS is always the life of the party)

Now you're ready to deploy faster than you can say "SaaS"! 🚀
